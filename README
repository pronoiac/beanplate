beanplate - a tool for filtering the Metafilter Infodump.

The intent is to allow one to filter a file by criteria.  
Show posts from October 2009: 
  ./beanplate.pl -c "datestamp =~ /2009-10/" -i postdata_mefi.txt

List users with 3-character usernames: 
  ./beanplate.pl -i usernames.txt -c "name =~ /^...$/" 

Show comments with the same id # as their post:
  cat commentdata_* | ./beanplate.pl -i - -c "commentid eq postid" 
  (this only shows a couple of first comments to first posts in subsites)

Show Metafilter posts without titles (note, there are 21,000):
  ./beanplate.pl -i posttitles_mefi.txt -c "title =~ /^$/"
